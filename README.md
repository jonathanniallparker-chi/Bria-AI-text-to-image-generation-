This project uses text-to-image generation for one product image and outputs a 3Ã—3 catalog. It takes 4 prompts, 1 for the base image (object) and 3 for background generation. After the base image is generated, the original background is removed, and the 3 background prompts are used. It then moves the object around the 3 backgrounds to create create variational placements, which results in a 3x3 grid of 1 object, 3 backgrounds, 3 variational placements.
